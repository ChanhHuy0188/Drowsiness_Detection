# Drowsiness_Detection
My real first project. 

It is not really perfect but it is my first step to go deeper in AI.

I have all of comments in code to explain the meaning of my code.

There are a large number of problems in my code that I think I need to use a different way to detect Drowsiness because if I use this code, it will alarm if drivers are not looking foreward. However, drivers have to look some directions such as mirrors when turning and back side when reverse.

I search a lot and i think, I will use drowsiness signal to detect. Maybe it will be better !
